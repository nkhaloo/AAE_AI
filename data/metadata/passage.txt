I took a seat and had a beep next to my teeth. I bit down. A sudden zap shocked a lazy cat, light on its feet. It jumped onto a deck. It made me want to seek out some mice. I quickly looked at my kit and began to dig some peat next to a pit, not about to step in some soft moss, or get stuff on my cheek. A guy tried to toss some soda at me.
At a shop, I ate soup, a piece of cake, and a sip of soda, very safe. Outside, a jock who had a sock tossed a bat with a beat. A guy shouted, and I shot out of my spot.
A cop helped me pick a gift—a sheet of goop—I asked if it was a dupe. I bought a wooden box and put it in my pack. I was at my peak.
At home, I could not keep my eyes open and chose to sit on my bed, next to my boot. A quick tick from a clock made me think of a missed date and a tax which had led to debt which was fit.
A fake duke who had on a suit and a cape spoke about his fate on a ship and how he had witnessed a dot on a tip of a map. He has a tat of a fat tooth who had a tube of paste. He got it when he was caught in a storm, just as he saw a dock. Once, he spoke about how he had taken a dip in seas that had fish. He was a kook. Goodness sake.
I sought to talk to my boss about how I was dead sleepy. Instead, I had a bowl of food, watched a movie about a chip, got to sleep, and saw a big gate. I woke up to a shape of someone about to take my tape. I had to beg this guy to replace my loss.
Last night, I saw a tiny tot who had a toy. I also saw a vet who made a bet and found a tap. I saw a jet that was mid-flight, and a duck who liked to peck. I saw a skater, about to shoot the gap, a guy who had lots of pep, and a flock of birds who fought about some bait. I saw a pet that sat, who liked a pat. I saw a soda with no cap, and a baby who had a loop. I saw some waste and a pot. A big alarm sounded loud and deep. I woke up and had one last sleepy thought. I went and took a walk and got some soda. This taught me some lessons.
