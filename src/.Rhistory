I took a seat and had a beep next to my teeth. I bit down. A sudden zap shocked a lazy cat, light on its feet. It jumped onto a deck. It made me want to seek out some mice. I quickly looked at my kit and began to dig some peat next to a shallow pit, mindful not to step in some soft moss, or get stuff on my cheek. My pal wanted to toss some soda at me.
At a shop, I ate soup, a slice of cake, and a sip of soda, all safe. Outside, a jock who had a sock tossed a baseball bat with a beat. Someone shouted, and I almost shot out of my place.
A cop helped me pick a gift—a sheet of goop—I asked if it was a dupe. I bought a small wooden box and put it gently in my pack. I felt like I was at my peak.
At home, I couldn't keep my eyes open and chose to sit on my bed, next to my boot. A quick tick from a clock made me think of a missed date and a tax which had led to debt which was fit.
A fake duke who had on a suit and a cape spoke about his fate on a ship and how he had once yelled about a dot on a tip of an old map. He has an old tat of a fat tooth who had a tube of paste. He got it when he was caught in a storm just as he saw a dock. Once, he spoke about how he had taken a dip in seas full of fish. He was a kook. Goodness sake.
I sought to talk to my boss about how I was dead sleepy. Instead, I had a bowl of food, watched a film about a chip, fell asleep, and saw a big gate. I woke up to a shape of someone about to take my tape. I had to beg my pal to go find some and fix the loss.
Last night, I saw a tiny tot who had a toy. I also saw a vet who made a bet and found a tap. I saw a jet that was mid-flight, and a duck who liked to peck. I saw a skater, about to shoot the gap, a mate who had lots of pep, and a flock of birds who fought about some bait. I saw a pet that sat, who liked a pat. I saw a soda bottle with no cap, and a baby who had chicken pox that runs about a loop. I saw a chute of waste and a pot of gold. A bell sounded loud and deep. I woke up and had one last sleepy thought. I went and took a walk and found some soda. Overall, this taught me some lessons.
